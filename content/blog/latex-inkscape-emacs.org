* Setup
Before we cook lets prepare the meat.

#+begin_quote
By the way, you can use fanilla emacs too. I have try configuring my vanilla emacs, it works, but slower than doom emacs (i am not good at lisp yet).
#+end_quote

So open your doom emacs =init.el= at =~/.config/doom/init.el= or =~/doom.d/init.el= and uncomment the =latex= module with =+latexmk= and =+lsp= flags. Now reload your config by executing =M-x doom-reload= (or =SPC-h-r-r=)

We also need a python script called =inkscape-figure= made by Gilles Castel (RIP.). To install inkscape-figure: run

#+begin_src sh
pip3 install inkscape-figure
#+end_src

Inkscape-figure, require us to have rofi (of course we can use another menu, maybe dmenu or wofi) i left that as an exercise for you (says mathbook). For now, let's install rofi

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install rofi # debian based
sudo pacman -s rofi # arch based
sudo dnf install rofi # fedora and family
#+end_src
